# Hello, I'm Teuzin! ðŸ‘‹

I started my programming journey because of a great friend of mine, **Luziberto Mendes**. He always encouraged me to explore the world of technology and was one of the main reasons I decided to follow this path. Also, my fascination with **Matrix** had a huge impact on my decision to dive into programming, with all its complexity and cultural influence from the trilogy.

## Career ðŸš€

My career started in a hands-on and curious way, with many challenges that helped me grow both as a programmer and as a leader. Over time, I delved deeper into various programming languages like **PHP**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and many others. I've had the opportunity to work at companies like **Bluebenx**, **PluralMed**, and **Unvoid**, where I applied my knowledge, solved real-world problems, and grew professionally.
