I'm a young programmer who recently started university and has quickly fallen in love with the world of programming. Through various courses on Udemy, I've expanded my knowledge, especially in technologies like SQL, PHP, Python, and API integration. Among these, Python is my true passion, and I feel most at home when working with it. I love how Python allows me to write clean, functional code for multitasking, from automations to web scripts. Every day, I grow more excited by its versatility and the endless possibilities it offers. Python is my language, and I'm just getting started! Iâ€™m also working on some practical projects, which Iâ€™m posting on my GitHub.
